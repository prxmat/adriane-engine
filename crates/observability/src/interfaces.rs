//! The observability seams: [`Tracer`], [`MetricCollector`], and
//! [`ObservabilityBus`] — the Rust port of `@adriane/observability`'s
//! `interfaces.ts`.
//!
//! The TS interfaces are synchronous; the Rust traits mirror that (no `async`).
//! All methods take `&self` so in-memory implementations can use interior
//! mutability and remain `Send + Sync`.
