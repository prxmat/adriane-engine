//! Prebuilt micro-task agent definitions.
//!
//! A [`PrebuiltAgent`] is a *definition*, not a runtime: it carries the system
//! prompt, the capability [`ModelTier`] it wants, the tool names it may call,
//! whether it must suspend for human approval before acting, and the channel its
//! result lands in. The concrete model is resolved later (Phase C) by the
//! `ModelPolicy` in `adriane-llm-gateway`, given the providers actually
//! available — so a definition stays portable across "I only have Mistral" and
//! "only Anthropic" deployments.
//!
//! All field names serialise as `camelCase` to stay wire-compatible with the TS
//! `@adriane-ai/*` types.
