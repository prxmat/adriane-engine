# Adriane polyglot SDKs

Adriane SDKs are thin surfaces over one Rust engine. The TypeScript SDK keeps its
N-API bridge for Node packaging and async JS callback ergonomics. Python uses
PyO3 for wheels. The remaining SDKs start from the stable C ABI in `crates/c-api`,
including the callback-capable runtime entry points.

## Binding strategy

| Family | Languages | Default binding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scripting | JavaScript, TypeScript | Existing N-API bridge (`crates/bindings`) |
| Scripting | Python | Existing PyO3 wheel (`crates/py-bindings`) |
| Scripting | Ruby, PHP, Lua, PowerShell | C ABI (`crates/c-api`) |
| Systems | C, C++, Zig, Swift, Objective-C | C ABI (`crates/c-api`) |
| Systems | Go | C ABI through cgo |
| Systems | Rust | Direct Rust crates |
| JVM / .NET | Java, Kotlin, Scala, C# | C ABI through JNA/JNI or P/Invoke |
| BEAM | Elixir | C ABI through a small NIF or port driver |

## Stable surface

The callback-neutral contract is:

- `engine_version`
- `validate_graph_json`
- `compile_graph_yaml_json`
- `available_providers_json`
- `resolve_model_json`
- `list_components_json`
- `list_prebuilt_json`
- `run_component_json`
- `run_prebuilt_json`

This gives every SDK the same validator, DSL compiler, model policy, catalogs,
native component runs, and prebuilt-agent runs immediately, without duplicating
the engine.

The callback-capable runtime contract is:

- `engine_run_json`
- `engine_resume_json`
- `engine_approve_and_resume_json`
- `engine_signal_json`
- `engine_replay_json`

These functions consume the same `EngineSpec` JSON used by the TypeScript N-API
bridge and call host callbacks for custom nodes, host-backed tools, conditional
predicates, and lifecycle/token events.

## Memory contract

Every ABI function that returns a string returns an owned UTF-8 C string. SDKs
must copy it into their native string type, then call `adriane_string_free` or
`adriane_result_free`.

Never free Adriane-owned strings with a host allocator.

Callback results are different: string callbacks return an integer status and
fill borrowed `value` / `error` output pointers owned by the host. The C ABI
copies them during the callback call and never frees them. Callback adapters must
keep those pointers valid until the callback returns and must be safe to invoke
from runtime worker threads.

## Layout

- `lua/`, `ruby/`, `php/`, and `powershell/` cover the remaining scripting surfaces.
- `go/`, `cpp/`, `zig/`, `swift/`, and `objc/` cover systems-language consumers.
- `csharp/` covers .NET; `jvm/` exposes Java plus Kotlin/Scala delegates.
- `elixir/` provides the BEAM entry point through a small C NIF.
- Future SDK packages should add native builders on top of these JSON methods,
  not reimplement engine behavior.
