# Middleware & profiles

Every agent node runs its ReAct loop through one ordered **middleware stack**. The stack has two
layers:

- a **governed** layer — PII redaction, the human-approval gate, the filesystem policy. It is
  **engine-injected and sealed**: you cannot add to it, remove from it, or turn it off.
- an **efficiency** layer — compression, terse output, context-budget trimming, reflection. This
  is the **user-tunable** layer you compose with `profile` and `middleware`.

That split is the *governed-by-construction* guarantee: an ungoverned agent is unrepresentable.
A user can only ever add efficiency middleware — the governance layer is always present.

```ts
import { createGraph, DefaultLLMGateway } from "@adriane-ai/graph-sdk";

createGraph({ name: "deep" })
  .agentNode("worker", {
    llm: new DefaultLLMGateway(),
    prompt: { system: "Investigate and report." },
    profile: "governed-deep"   // tier + efficiency middleware + suspend + fs, in one word
  })
  .compile();
```

## Profiles

A **profile** is a named bundle: a model tier, a set of efficiency middleware, and
suspend / filesystem defaults. It is the one-word way to dial an agent's posture. The governed
layer is identical across all profiles — you cannot buy out of governance.

| Profile | Tier | Efficiency middleware | Suspends for approval | Filesystem |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `fast` | `fast` | compress + terse + context-budget (4k) | no | off |
| `frontier-careful` | `frontier` | context-budget (16k) + reflection, **no compression** | yes | off |
| `governed-deep` | `balanced` | compress + terse + context-budget (12k) + reflection | yes | **on** |

- `fast` — high-throughput, low-stakes prose. Compresses and trims aggressively.
- `frontier-careful` — high-stakes reasoning where lossy compression is unsafe. Keeps the full
  text, reflects on its own answer, and suspends for human approval.
- `governed-deep` — the deep-agent one-liner: a governed agent with the virtual filesystem, the
  full efficiency stack, reflection, and suspend-on-approval.

An **explicit field always wins over the profile**. Set `tier`, `suspendForApproval`, `enableFs`,
`outputStyle`, `contextBudget`, or `middleware` directly and your value overrides the profile's
default:

```ts
.agentNode("worker", {
  llm,
  prompt: { system: "…" },
  profile: "governed-deep",
  tier: "frontier",          // override balanced → frontier
  suspendForApproval: false  // override the profile's suspend default
})
```

## Efficiency middleware

`middleware` appends efficiency middleware to whatever the profile (and the flat
`outputStyle` / `contextBudget` knobs) already contribute. The kinds:

| Kind | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `{ kind: "compress" }` | Route messages through the prompt-compression service (a no-op when it is not configured — see [token optimization](#token-optimization-knobs)). |
| `{ kind: "terse" }` | Append a compact-output directive to the system prompt. Lossy — prose only, not code. |
| `{ kind: "contextBudget", params: { chars } }` | Cap the agent's seed message (the injected `Input` / `State` dump) to `chars` characters. |
| `{ kind: "reflection", params?: { threshold? } }` | One self-critique after the run — see [reflection](#reflection). |
| `{ kind: "structuredOutput", params: { schema, name?, strict?, mode?, retryCap? } }` | Constrain the output to a JSON Schema — see [structured output](#structured-output). |

```ts
.agentNode("writer", {
  llm,
  prompt: { system: "Draft a release note." },
  middleware: [{ kind: "terse" }, { kind: "contextBudget", params: { chars: 8000 } }]
})
```

The SDK desugars `profile` + the flat `outputStyle` / `contextBudget` knobs + your explicit
`middleware` into one ordered, **deduplicated** list (most specific wins: explicit `middleware`
overrides the flat knobs, which override the profile). The order within the efficiency layer does
not change behaviour — the hooks act on disjoint parts of the request.

### Governance kinds are rejected

The governance middleware — redaction, the approval gate, the filesystem policy — are *not* part
of the `middleware` type. They are engine-injected. Passing one (e.g. from untyped JavaScript)
throws:

```ts
import { GovernanceMiddlewareRejectedError } from "@adriane-ai/graph-sdk";

// { kind: "redact" } is not an EfficiencyMiddlewareSpec — the SDK rejects it at build time.
```

This is what makes an ungoverned stack unrepresentable: you cannot express "an agent without the
approval gate", and you cannot smuggle a governance middleware into the user layer.

## The lifecycle hooks

Under the hood the stack drives seven pass-through hooks around the ReAct loop. You rarely touch
them directly from the SDK (you compose with profiles and `middleware`), but they explain *where*
each behaviour runs:

| Hook | When | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `before_run` | once, after state injection, before the loop | context-budget trim |
| `before_model` | before each `gateway.complete()` | redaction (governed), compression, terse |
| `after_model` | after each completion | redaction hydrate (governed) |
| `before_tool` | before a tool executes | the approval gate (governed), filesystem policy (governed) |
| `after_tool` | after a tool's handler returns | observation transforms |
| `on_iteration` | at each loop-turn end | loop-detection / budget |
| `after_run` | after the loop, before the result | reflection |

Request-path hooks run governed → efficiency (governance outermost); response-path hooks run in
reverse (onion semantics). The approval gate is **intrinsic** to `before_tool` — it applies even
when no middleware is installed, so a bare agent still gates its sensitive tools.

## Token optimization knobs

Compression and context-budget are the two token levers, both surfaced as efficiency middleware
(and as the flat `outputStyle: "terse"` / `contextBudget` knobs, which desugar to the same list):

- **`terse`** appends a compact-output directive to the system prompt. Lossy, so the profiles only
  use it where prose quality is not at stake (`fast`, `governed-deep`), never on `frontier-careful`.
- **`contextBudget`** caps the injected seed message so an unbounded channel map is not re-fed to
  the model on every turn.
- **`compress`** routes message content through an external prompt-compression service
  (LLMLingua-style), configured by the `ADRIANE_LLMLINGUA_URL` env var. It **fails open** — when
  the service is not configured the request passes through unchanged, so a `compress` entry is
  simply a no-op.

**Prompt caching is automatic** — not a knob. The Anthropic adapter marks the system prompt and
tool definitions with `cache_control`, and every adapter reads the cached-token counts back into
`AgentResult` usage. Across a multi-turn ReAct loop the stable prefix (system + tools) is served
from the provider's cache, so you pay full price for it once, not on every iteration. Nothing to
configure — it applies whenever the provider supports it.

## Reflection

`{ kind: "reflection" }` runs **one self-critique** after the agent finishes: it asks the model to
score its own output, and when the critique rejects it, annotates the reasoning with a
`reflection:needs_review:<issues>` marker. It does **not** force a suspension — route on the marker
with a conditional edge if you want a weak answer to reach a human gate:

```ts
.agentNode("answer", { llm, prompt: { system: "Answer." }, middleware: [{ kind: "reflection" }] })
.humanGate("review")
.conditionalEdge(
  "answer", "review", "weak",
  (s) => s.channels.agentResult.reasoning.includes("reflection:needs_review")
)
```

Reflection is **additive** — it does not replace the standalone reflection node (the full
critique → revise loop). It is best-effort and **fails open**: a critique-call error never fails
the run.

## Structured output

`{ kind: "structuredOutput", params: { schema } }` constrains an agent's answer to a JSON Schema
and **validates it in the engine**. Two things happen, both on the deterministic Rust path:

1. **Native generation.** The engine sets the provider's own constraint — OpenAI
   `response_format: { type: "json_schema" }`, Gemini `responseSchema`, and (since Anthropic has no
   `response_format`) a **forced synthetic tool** whose schema is your schema. One neutral field,
   fanned out per provider.
2. **Validation floor.** The result is parsed and checked against the schema *in-engine* (real
   nested / enum / format conformance), so a worker-executed run can never emit unvalidated output
   and the verdict is part of the audited run state. The validated value lands on
   `AgentResult.structuredOutput`.

```ts
.agentNode("classifier", {
  llm,
  prompt: { system: "Classify the ticket." },
  middleware: [{
    kind: "structuredOutput",
    params: {
      name: "Triage",
      schema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
          severity: { type: "string", enum: ["low", "high"] },
          summary: { type: "string" }
        },
        required: ["severity", "summary"]
      }
    }
  }]
})
```

```ts
const result = await app.run({ ... });
const triage = result.channels.agentResult.structuredOutput; // { severity, summary }
```

| Param | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | — (required) | The JSON Schema the output must match. Without it the middleware is a no-op. |
| `name` | `"Output"` | The schema name (OpenAI `json_schema.name`; the Anthropic forced-tool name). |
| `strict` | `true` | Request the provider's strict-decoding mode where it exists. |
| `mode` | `"required"` | `required` fails **closed** (a typed error, surfaced as channel data) after `retryCap` re-prompts; `lenient` falls back to raw text. |
| `retryCap` | `2` | Bounded, deterministic corrective re-prompts on invalid output (no temperature drift, so replay is stable). |

**Governance still holds.** `structuredOutput` is an efficiency kind (output-shaping); the
approval gate is intrinsic to `before_tool`, so a structured result can never route around a
sensitive-tool gate. Validation runs before the gate, so the gate sees validated JSON. See
[ADR 0029](https://github.com/prxmat/adriane-engine/blob/main/docs/adr/0029-governed-structured-output.md)
