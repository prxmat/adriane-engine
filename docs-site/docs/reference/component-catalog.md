# Component catalog

The `components` surface (`packages/graph-sdk/src/components.ts`) is a library of **pure,
deterministic, no-LLM** compute building blocks, each addressable by a string `kind` plus a
typed `params` object. Each factory returns a `ComponentDescriptor` — the `{ kind, params }`
carrier the Rust engine runs natively, plus a faithful TypeScript handler for the fallback path.
The TS library mirrors the Rust `adriane_components` crate one-for-one in kind, params and
behaviour, so the two agree byte-for-byte on ASCII input.

Add a component with [`builder.component(...)`](/docs/reference/builder-api#componentid-descriptor-options):

```ts
import { createGraph, components } from "@adriane-ai/graph-sdk";

const app = createGraph({ name: "clean" })
  .channel("raw", { type: "string", default: "<b>Hi</b>  there" })
  .channel("clean", { type: "string", default: "" })
  .component("c", components.textCleaner({ from: "raw", into: "clean", stripHtml: true, collapseWhitespace: true }))
  .compile();

const result = await app.run({ raw: "<b>Hi</b>  there" });
console.log(result.channels.clean);
```

Expected result: prints `Hi there`.

:::note Two components are pure routers
`router` and `conditionalRouter` only **write a route string into a channel**; they do not
branch the graph. Pair them with a [`conditionalEdge`](/docs/reference/builder-api#conditionaledgefrom-to-conditionname-predicate)
that reads that channel to actually route.
:::

Below, every `kind` with its params. Required params have no default; optional params show
their default.

## Text & template

### `promptBuilder`

Render every `{{var}}` placeholder from the channels into a target channel (whitespace inside
braces tolerated; unknown placeholders render empty).

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `template` | `string` | — | Template with `{{var}}` placeholders. |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel the rendered string is written into. |

### `textCleaner`

Normalise a text channel. Fixed order regardless of param order: stripHtml → lowercase →
collapseWhitespace → trim.

| `trim` | `boolean` | `false` | Trim leading/trailing whitespace. |

### `htmlToText`

Strip HTML tags and decode the common named entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&amp;` —
`&amp;` decoded last so `&amp;lt;` → `&lt;`).

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | `string` | — | Channel holding the HTML text. |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel receiving the tag-stripped, entity-decoded text. |

character classes, quantifiers, or capture groups).

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | `string` | — | Channel holding the text to match. |

| `expectType` | `"string" \| "number" \| "boolean" \| "object" \| "array" \| "null"` | `undefined` | Expected JSON type. |

### `outputParser`

Find the first balanced JSON object or array in a text channel and parse it (skipping over
string literals so braces inside strings don't confuse depth). Writes `null` when nothing parses.

### `languageDetector`

Heuristic stopword-based language detection over `en / fr / es / de / it`; ties break in that
fixed order, no hits yields `"und"`.

### `chatMessageBuilder`

Assemble a role-tagged `[{ role, content }]` chat-message array an LLM generator consumes. Each
spec's `content` is rendered through the `{{var}}` engine; `contentFrom` reads a channel
verbatim.

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel receiving the message array. |
| `messages` | `ChatMessageSpec[]` | — | Ordered message specs (see below). |
| `systemFrom` | `string` | `undefined` | Channel prepended as a leading system message when non-empty. |

`ChatMessageSpec`: `{ role: "system" | "user" | "assistant"; content?: string; contentFrom?: string }`.

## Routing (pure predicates)

:::note These write a route, they do not branch
Both `router` and `conditionalRouter` are pure predicates that **write a route string into a
channel**. They never change the graph's control flow on their own — pair them with a
`conditionalEdge` reading the route channel.
:::

### `router`

Pick a route from a channel value against ordered rules (first match wins).

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `from` | `string` | — | Channel whose value is matched. |
| `rules` | `RouterRule[]` | — | Ordered rules; first match wins. |
| `defaultRoute` | `string` | — | Route emitted when no rule matches. |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel the chosen route string is written into. |

`RouterRule`: `{ equals?: string; contains?: string; route: string }`. Both predicates must
hold when both are set; a rule with neither set never matches.

### `conditionalRouter`

Multi-branch rule routing over the channels (first matching branch wins). Each branch's `when`
is a `{ field, op, value? }` predicate (same `PredicateOp` vocabulary as `metadataFilter`),
`field` is a dotted path into the channels.

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel the chosen route string is written into. |
| `defaultRoute` | `string` | — | Route emitted when no branch matches. |
| `branches` | `ConditionalRouterBranch[]` | — | Ordered branches; first match wins. |

`ConditionalRouterBranch`: `{ when: { field: string; op: PredicateOp; value?: unknown }; route: string }`.

## Evaluation

### `evaluator`

Score actual vs expected text, with an optional pass flag.

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `expectedFrom` | `string` | — | Channel holding the expected/reference text. |
| `actualFrom` | `string` | — | Channel holding the actual/candidate text. |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel receiving the numeric score in `[0, 1]`. |
| `metric` | `"tokenF1" \| "overlap" \| "exact"` | `"tokenF1"` | Scoring metric. |
| `passInto` | `string` | `undefined` | Optional channel receiving `score >= threshold`. |
| `threshold` | `number` | `0.5` | Pass threshold for `passInto`. |

## Integration components (vendor I/O)

These two are **not** pure Rust components: they have no `{ kind, params }` carrier and return a
plain `NodeHandler` (a closure over an injected I/O impl). Add them with
[`node(...)`](/docs/reference/builder-api#nodeid-handlerorconfig), not `component(...)`. On the
Rust engine they run over the async JS seam like any other JS handler.

```ts
createGraph({ name: "fetch" })
  .channel("body", { type: "json", default: null })
  .node("get", components.httpFetch({ url: "https://example.com", into: "body", fetchImpl: fakeFetch }));
```

:::warning Network access and graceful degradation
Both default to the real `globalThis.fetch`. They **never throw** — a failure is surfaced as
data so a graph degrades gracefully. Inject `fetchImpl` / `searchImpl` / `transport` to stay
offline in tests.
:::

### `httpFetch`

Perform an HTTP request, writing an `HttpFetchResult` to `into`. On a completed response:
`{ status, ok, body, json? }` (`json` present only when the `content-type` is JSON). On a
transport error / timeout: `{ ok: false, error }`.

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel receiving the `HttpFetchResult`. |
| `url` | `string` | `undefined` | A literal URL (mutually exclusive with `urlFrom`). |
| `urlFrom` | `string` | `undefined` | Channel supplying the URL (takes precedence when its channel is set). |
| `method` | `string` | `"GET"` | HTTP method. |
| `headers` | `Record<string, string>` | `undefined` | Request headers. |
| `body` | `string` | `undefined` | Request body (verbatim) for non-GET methods. |
| `timeoutMs` | `number` | `undefined` | Abort after this many ms (drives an `AbortController`). |
| `fetchImpl` | `HttpFetchImpl` | `globalThis.fetch` | Injectable transport (`Response`-shaped). |

### `webSearch`

Run a web search, writing a `WebSearchOutcome` (`{ results, note? }`) to `into`. The default is
a real Tavily connector behind `TAVILY_API_KEY`: when the key is set it POSTs to
`https://api.tavily.com/search` and normalizes results to `[{ title, url, snippet }]`; when the
key is **absent it makes no network call** and returns empty results plus a note.

| Param | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `into` | `string` | — | Channel receiving the `WebSearchOutcome`. |
| `query` | `string` | `undefined` | A literal query (mutually exclusive with `queryFrom`). |
| `queryFrom` | `string` | `undefined` | Channel supplying the query (takes precedence when its channel is set). |
| `k` | `number` | `3` | Number of results to request. |
| `searchImpl` | `WebSearchImpl` | Tavily connector | Injectable search implementation. |
| `transport` | `WebSearchTransport` | `globalThis.fetch` | HTTP transport the default Tavily connector posts through (ignored when `searchImpl` is supplied). |
