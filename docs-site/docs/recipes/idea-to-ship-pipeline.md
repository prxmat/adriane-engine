# Idea-to-ship pipeline

The capstone recipe: a single run that chains several agent nodes and exercises **both**
governance seams Adriane offers in one pipeline —

1. a **`humanGate`** (`brand-review`) — a structural pause in the graph, and
2. a **native agent suspension** — the security agent reaches for an approval-gated tool
   (`deploy_to_prod`) and the run suspends through a real `ApprovalEngine`; a human approves; the
   run resumes and deploys.

It runs offline on scripted mock LLMs and is self-verifying. The full program is the shipped
[`examples/startup-e2e.ts`](https://github.com/adriane-ai/adriane/blob/main/packages/graph-sdk/examples/startup-e2e.ts).

```

## The pipeline

Each agent node gets its own scripted gateway and its own output channel. Two tools: an ungated
scaffolder (`scaffold_mvp`) and a gated production deploy (`deploy_to_prod`, `requiresApproval:
true`). The security agent is wired with an `ApprovalEngine`, which routes its approval through a
human.

```ts
import {
  createGraph,
  DefaultLLMGateway,
  InMemoryToolRegistry,
  MockLLMProviderAdapter,
  type LLMGateway,
  type LLMResponse,

// Scripted mock turns: a tool_use turn, then a FINAL: turn.
let toolUseSeq = 0;
const toolTurn = (name: string, input: Record<string, unknown> = {}): LLMResponse => ({
  content: "",
  toolCalls: [{ id: `tu_${(toolUseSeq += 1)}`, name, input }],
  stopReason: "tool_use",
  usage: { promptTokens: 0, completionTokens: 0 },
  model: "mock",
  provider: "anthropic"
});
const finalTurn = (content: string): LLMResponse => ({
  content,
  usage: { promptTokens: 0, completionTokens: 0 },
  model: "mock",
  provider: "anthropic"
});
const scripted = (responses: LLMResponse[]): LLMGateway => {
  const gateway = new DefaultLLMGateway();
  gateway.registerAdapter(new MockLLMProviderAdapter({ provider: "anthropic", responses }));
  return gateway;
};
const passthrough = { parse: (value: unknown) => value };

// Tools: an ungated scaffolder and a gated production deploy.

  async () => {
    scaffoldCount += 1;
    return { scaffolded: true, files: 12 };
  }
);

let deployCount = 0;
const securityTools = new InMemoryToolRegistry();

:::warning Mock sequencing across suspend/resume
The scripted gateway is **stateful across suspend/resume**. When the security agent suspends on
the gated tool and is later resumed, it **re-runs** and consumes the *next* scripted response —
so the gated `tool_use` turn is scripted **twice in a row**, then the `FINAL:` turn. This is a
property of the deterministic mock, not the engine. (Source: the example's KEY comment in
`examples/startup-e2e.ts`.)
:::

## Run it act by act

Subscribe to the lifecycle journal, then drive the run through its three acts. The journal
pattern is the same one in the [dashboard recipe](./stream-to-dashboard).

```ts
const journal: string[] = [];
app.onEvent((event) => {
  const node = "nodeId" in event ? `:${String(event.nodeId)}` : "";
  journal.push(`${event.type}${node}`);
});

const RUN_ID = "run_startup_e2e_demo" as RunId;

// Act 1: run until the brand-review human gate.
const atBrandReview = await app.run({}, { runId: RUN_ID });
console.log(atBrandReview.status);              // "suspended"
console.log(atBrandReview.currentNodeId);       // "brand-review"
console.log(atBrandReview.channels.brandName);  // "Lumora" — extracted into its channel

// Act 2: the founder approves the brand; the build runs until the gated deploy.
const atSecurityGate = await app.resume(RUN_ID);
console.log(atSecurityGate.status);             // "suspended"
console.log(atSecurityGate.currentNodeId);      // "security-audit"
// scaffold_mvp ran (ungated); deploy_to_prod has NOT (gated, awaiting approval).

const pending = await engine.getPending(RUN_ID);
console.log(pending.length);                    // 1
console.log(pending[0]?.requestedBy);           // "security-audit"

// Act 3: a human (the founder) approves the deploy through the engine; the run ships.
await engine.approve(pending[0]!.id, "founder");
const shipped = await app.resume(RUN_ID);
console.log(shipped.status);                    // "completed"
console.log(shipped.channels.shipped);          // true
```

**Expected result:**

```text
suspended
brand-review
Lumora
suspended
security-audit
1
security-audit
completed
true
```

The journal records **exactly two** `run_suspended` entries (the brand gate, then the deploy
gate) and one `run_completed`. The ungated `scaffold_mvp` executes exactly once during Act 2; the
gated `deploy_to_prod` executes exactly once during Act 3 — **never before its approval**.

## The two governance seams, contrasted

| | `humanGate("brand-review")` | `security-audit` agent + `ApprovalEngine` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| What suspends | a structural node in the graph | the agent reaching a `requiresApproval` tool |
| How it resumes | `app.resume(runId)` | approve the engine request, then `app.resume(runId)` |
| Who decides | any out-of-band human signal | a principal that is **not** the requesting agent |
| Recorded as | a `run_suspended` event | an `ApprovalRequest` (`requestedBy = security-audit`) + event |

The whole pipeline above is the **open SDK** — you embed it in your own process and drive it with
`run` / `resume`. In production, *who* signs off at each seam and *where* the audit trail lives is
a control-plane concern: **Adriane Studio** (the managed governance platform) binds each approval
to an authenticated principal, persists the journal, and runs suspended pipelines on a worker
fleet — or you build the same on top of the SDK approval API. The engine enforces the invariant
either way (no self-approval, attestation, lifecycle events); the control plane decides and
records.

:::note Why this graph runs on the TypeScript engine
This example wires the `security-audit` agent with a TypeScript `approvalEngine`. The
engine-backed approval flow (file a request per gated tool, read the engine's decision on
resume) is a TypeScript-path feature, so a graph using it stays on the TS engine under the
default `"auto"` policy. The Rust engine remains the production runtime for everything else — for
the cross-process, Rust-backed governed resume, route approvals through `runCatalogGraph`'s
`approvalEngine` option instead (see [resume across processes](./resume-across-processes)).
