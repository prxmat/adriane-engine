/**
 * Reference pipeline — Doc-QA (retrieval-augmented question answering), end to end.
 *
 * A COMPLETE input → output pipeline composed entirely from the catalog and run on the
 * engine (Rust when the `@adriane-ai/napi` addon is present, else the TS fallback):
 *
 *   INPUT { question, documents }
 *     → clean    (textCleaner)       normalise the raw documents text
 *     → split    (documentSplitter)  chunk it into passages
 *     → retrieve (retriever)         deterministic mock-embedding top-k over the corpus
 *     → rerank   (reranker)          reorder the hits against the question
 *     → prompt   (promptBuilder)     build a grounded prompt from context + question
 *     → answer   (AGENT, balanced)   a grounded RAG answerer writes its AgentResult
 *     → extract  (fieldExtractor)    reduce AgentResult.reasoning to the final answer text
 *     → assemble (answerBuilder)     answer text + numbered citations → OUTPUT { answer }
 *   OUTPUT { answer }
 *
 * Single input set, single output channel.
 *
 * ── OFFLINE vs LIVE (no key required to run) ──────────────────────────────────
 *   - no key            → the answerer runs on a deterministic MOCK gateway, so the
 *                         whole pipeline is reproducible with no network.
 *   - MISTRAL_API_KEY   → on the Rust engine the balanced tier resolves to a concrete
 *                         Mistral model and the answerer makes a real (short) call.
 *
 * Offline and self-verifying: every claim below is asserted — the process exits 1 on
 * the first failed assertion, so this example doubles as an end-to-end smoke test.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   pnpm --filter @adriane-ai/graph-sdk example:docqa
 *   pnpm --filter @adriane-ai/graph-sdk exec node --import tsx examples/doc-qa-reference.ts
