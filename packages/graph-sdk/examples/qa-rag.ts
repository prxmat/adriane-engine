/**
 * Tutorial — Question answering over your documents (governed QA).
 *
 * What you'll learn:
 *   - retrieval QA with an agent node: search → fetch → answer with a citation
 *   - the governance twist classic RAG stacks lack: a conditional edge routes any
 *     answer WITHOUT a citation into a human gate ("low-confidence-review") instead
 *     of publishing it blindly
 *   - both paths are demonstrated: a cited answer publishes straight through; an
 *     uncited answer suspends the run until a human resumes it
 *
 * Offline and self-verifying: the LLM is a scripted mock (no API key), and every
 * claim below is asserted — the process exits 1 on the first failed assertion, so
 * this tutorial doubles as an end-to-end test.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   pnpm --filter @adriane-ai/graph-sdk example:qa
