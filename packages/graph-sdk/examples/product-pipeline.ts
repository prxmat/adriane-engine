/**
 * Capstone — a GOVERNED product pipeline, brief → ship, composed from the catalog
 * and run on the engine (Rust when the `@adriane-ai/napi` addon is present, else the
 * TypeScript fallback — the same graph runs on either).
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS DEMONSTRATES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A single graph that exercises every layer of `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` at once:
 *   - a PURE component (`components.promptBuilder`) that runs natively on Rust,
 *   - a REAL connector (`semanticRetriever`) grounding the work in a seeded corpus,
 *   - AGENT NODES across three capability tiers (balanced / frontier / creative) —
 *     the {@link ModelPolicy} resolving each stage's concrete model from the
 *     providers actually available (Mistral-only env → the mistral column),
 *   - a HUMAN-APPROVAL GATE (`humanGate('ship-gate')`) — the governance core: the
 *     run SUSPENDS before anything ships and a human decides go/no-go, then a
 *     `resume(runId)` carries it through to launch copy.
 *
 * ── THE PIPELINE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   clarify → research → design → mvp → security → [ship-gate] → ship
 *
 *   1. clarify  — promptBuilder: {{brief}} → a focused researchQuery (pure, on Rust).
 *   2. research — semanticRetriever over a seeded corpus, then a balanced agent
 *                 writes a grounded research summary.
 *   3. design   — balanced agent: a product design outline from brief + research.
 *   4. mvp      — balanced agent: an MVP feature plan from the design.
 *   5. security — frontier agent: a security/risk review of the MVP (the costly
 *                 stage uses the top tier — the policy made visible).
 *   6. ship-gate— humanGate: GOVERNANCE. The run suspends; a human approves go/no-go.
 *   7. ship     — creative agent: launch / changelog copy from the approved plan.
 *
 * ── OFFLINE vs LIVE (no key required to run) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Embeddings: {@link semanticRetriever} defaults to real Mistral embeddings. To stay
 * runnable WITHOUT a key AND live WITH one, this example reads MISTRAL_API_KEY:
 *   - no key  → inject a tiny DETERMINISTIC fake embedder (no network, never crashes),
 *               and run the agents on a deterministic MOCK gateway,
 *   - a key   → use the real {@link createEmbeddings}() and let the agents resolve
 *               their tier to a real Mistral model and make real (short) calls.
 *
 * Capability tiers: the per-stage tier is always RESOLVED and reported through the
 * {@link ModelPolicy} (`resolveAgentModel`) so you can see "balanced/frontier/creative
 * → <concrete model>" for the current env. Offline (mock gateway) the agent nodes run
 * tier-agnostic so the run completes deterministically on either engine; with a key
 * the tier is bound to the agent so the policy drives the real model choice.
 *
 * Run it:
 *   pnpm --filter @adriane-ai/graph-sdk example:product
 *   pnpm --filter @adriane-ai/graph-sdk exec node --import tsx examples/product-pipeline.ts
