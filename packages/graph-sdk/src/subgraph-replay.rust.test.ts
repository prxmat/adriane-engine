/**
 * ADR 0043 D3 — `replayCatalogGraph` gains `subgraphs`, unblocked by D1 (`LlmRequest.run_id`,
 * `adriane-engine` PR #198) + D2 (run-scoped journal matching, PR #199) + the fork-invariant
 * tagging fix (PR #200): a replay's requests now carry the SAME logical run id the record pass
 * used, so `ReplayGateway`'s request-equality match discriminates a parent's calls from a
 * subgraph child's instead of the two racing for the same journal entries.
 *
 * Before this, `replayCatalogGraph` dropped `subgraphs` entirely (`undefined`) and a
 * `subgraphId` node failed loudly with `SubgraphNotFound` rather than silently diverging —
 * the second test below proves that guard still holds when `subgraphs` is omitted.
 *
 * Skipped when the native addon is absent. Offline/deterministic: provider keys are cleared so
 * both the parent and child agent calls hit the stub path, not a real provider.
