   * Rust faithfully — the old "synchronous seam" limitation is gone. Two boundaries
   * remain, and they shape the `"auto"` policy:
   *
   * 1. The Rust agent path builds its **own** LLM gateway from env (Mistral / Anthropic
   *    / Ollama / a deterministic mock); it does *not* use the TS `AgentNodeConfig.llm`.
   *    That is the intended "engine on Rust" behavior (the proven live path). The TS
   *    `llm` is consulted only on the TS fallback path. Observable *structure* (final
   *    status, suspend-on-approval, approve-and-resume, lifecycle events) is identical
   *    across engines on the deterministic mock — proven by the fidelity test in
   *    `rust-engine.test.ts`. Only the `AgentResult.reasoning` *text* differs (the two
   *    mocks emit different strings), which is not part of the structural contract.
   * 2. The TS {@link import("@adriane-ai/approval-engine").ApprovalEngine}-backed approval
   *    flow (file a request per gated tool, read the engine's decision on resume) lives
   *    in `createAgentNodeHandler`; the Rust agent path does not invoke it. So an agent
   *    node configured with `approvalEngine` would not file requests on Rust.
   *
   * Therefore `"auto"` (the default) routes a graph to Rust when the addon is present
   * **unless** any agent node uses a TS `approvalEngine` — that one case stays on the
   * TS engine to preserve the engine-backed approval semantics. Everything else (agent
   * nodes on the Rust gateway, JS action/custom/tool nodes, human gates, named
   * conditions, channel-based `approveAndResume`) runs on Rust. When the addon is
   * absent it falls back to the TS engine. `"rust"` forces Rust regardless (the caller
   * accepts the Rust-gateway / no-`approvalEngine` contract); `"ts"` forces TypeScript.
   * The public SDK API is unchanged across engines.
   *
   * Two narrower limitations are *not* gated on (they affect both `auto` and `rust`,
   * but no SDK API surfaces them as a routing choice): a JS handler that returns a
   * routing {@link import("@adriane-ai/graph-core").Command} (`{ goto }`) has its `goto`
   * dropped on Rust (the seam applies a channel update + static-edge routing — build a
   * conditional edge instead); and a {@link GraphBuilder.toolNode} whose tool is
   * `requiresApproval` *fails* rather than suspends on Rust (its handler throws a
   * `DynamicInterrupt`, which the seam surfaces as a node failure, not a clean
   * suspension). Route such graphs with `ADRIANE_SDK_ENGINE=ts` if you need them.
