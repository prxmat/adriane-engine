/**
 * Optional bridge to the Rust engine's async run/resume/approve entry points
 * (`@adriane-ai/napi`). Mirrors {@link import("./rust-validator.js").tryRustValidate}:
 * when the native addon is present, graph **execution** can run on the Rust engine
 * (via `engine_run`/`engine_resume`/`engine_approve_and_resume`), with the SDK's TS
 * condition predicates and node/tool seams called back from Rust over a
 * ThreadsafeFunction. The Rust engine is the required production runtime; when the
 * addon is absent (development, tests, or an uncovered platform) this loader returns
 * `null` and {@link import("./compiled-graph.js").CompiledGraph} uses the in-process
 * TypeScript runtime instead.
 *
 * Boundary contract (napi 2.16, Phase F): the Rust seam now **awaits** the JS
 * callback's returned `Promise` — `call_async::<Promise<T>>(..).await?.await?` drives
 * a returned thenable to its resolved value. So `on_node` returns a `Promise<string>`
 * (channel-update / tool-result JSON) and `on_condition` returns a `Promise<string>`
 * (a boolean-ish string the Rust side reads with `parse_bool`). This is what lets the
 * SDK's genuinely-async TS node handlers and tool `execute` fns round-trip through
 * Rust without aborting the process. `on_event` stays fire-and-forget.
