 * - {@link sleepUntil} — a durable timer: the run waits until an external scheduler
 *   resumes it at `wakeAt` (the engine never sleeps — `wakeAt` is opaque data).
 * - {@link waitForSignal} — wait for a named external signal delivered via
 *   {@link import("./compiled-graph.js").CompiledGraph.signal}; optionally with a
 *   timeout `wakeAt` (signal-or-timeout).
 *
 * Both are reserved-key markers the Rust engine recognises across the napi seam; they
 * run on the Rust engine (the production runtime), not the TypeScript dev fallback.
