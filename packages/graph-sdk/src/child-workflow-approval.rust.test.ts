/**
 * ADR 0042 D2/D3 (product ADR 0068 D5.4, adriane-engine#177) — the falsifiable
 * approval-non-inheritance test.
 *
 * History: this test originally proved a GAP, not the intended property —
 * `fileApprovalRequests` walked only the top-level `definition.nodes`, so a child's
 * gated tool call filed ZERO `ApprovalEngine` requests at all (tracked as #177). Fixed
 * by having `fileApprovalRequests` also walk a DIRECT (non-fan-out) child's own nodes,
 * reading its `approvalRequests` from the nested `__subgraphStates[childRunId].channels`
 * snapshot `execute_subgraph` already writes on suspend, and qualifying the grant key
 * with the child's run id (`<childRunId>:<nodeId>`) so it can never collide with a
 * parent's own same-named node id. This test now proves that property directly —
 * `engine.request()` is called with a genuinely distinct grant key for the child's own
 * tool call, exactly what Revision 5 asked D5.4 to prove.
 *
 * Deliberately unchanged: a nested subgraph inside a subgraph, and `mapSubgraph`'s
 * dynamic N-child fan-out, are NOT walked — same scope D5.3's own run-gate injection
 * chose (no precomputable single id for either case). The second test below is a
 * non-regression marker for that boundary, not a claim those cases are safe.
