/**
 * ADR 0068 issue #496 — a `human-gate` node suspends the run (`execute_node` returns
 * `self.suspend(...)` unconditionally) but, unlike an agent's `suspendForApproval`, it
 * carries no `approvalRequests` payload of its own — before this fix, `resume()`'s ONLY
 * authorization check (`ensureNoPendingApprovals`, reading `ApprovalEngine.getPending`)
 * saw nothing pending for a `human-gate` suspension and would let a resume through with
 * NO decision ever recorded. The gate delayed; it did not authorize. This applies to
 * D5.3's own injected `__run_gate` node too, not just an authored `human-gate`.
 *
 * Fixed by having `fileApprovalRequests` file one request for the suspended node itself
 * when its type is `human-gate` (top-level or a direct child's), under a `"gate:"`-
 * prefixed subject so the control plane can tell a rejected GATE apart from a rejected
 * TOOL when deciding whether a run becomes `"rejected"` (a tool rejection just leaves a
 * tool unlocked; a gate rejection must block resume outright — that product-side check
 * is issue #496's own follow-up, not this engine-side filing fix).
 *
 * A review of the product ADR 0068 Revision 10 design (which assumed a genuinely
 * child-scoped attestation chain, `loadAttestationChain(childRunId)`) caught that a
 * child's gate request was filed under the PARENT's own `runId` (only `nodeId`/
 * `requestedBy` were child-qualified) — not attributable to the child at all. Fixed
 * alongside the same bug in `fileForGraphNodes` (child tool-call gates): `runId` passed
 * to `engine.request()` for a child's own gate is now the child's deterministic run id.
