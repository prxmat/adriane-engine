/**
 * Run a **catalog graph** on the Rust engine.
 *
 * A catalog graph is a plain {@link GraphDefinition} (e.g. one authored in the Studio
 * graph editor, persisted as data, with no in-process TS handlers) whose nodes carry
 * the SHARED CARRIER in `node.metadata`:
 *
 *   - a COMPONENT node carries `node.metadata.component = { kind, params }`
 *   - an AGENT node carries `node.metadata.agent = { provider?, model?, tier?, system?,
 *     toolNames?, maxIterations?, suspendForApproval?, approvalToolNames?, outputChannel? }`
 *
 * This is the seam the control plane (`apps/api`) uses to EXECUTE a graph built from
 * the catalog: it reads each node's metadata, assembles the engine's
 * `EngineSpec.componentNodes` + `agents` maps + the `jsNodeIds` for plain
 * action/tool nodes, and drives the run on the **Rust engine** via `@adriane-ai/napi`.
 *
 * Unlike {@link import("./builder.js").GraphBuilder}, there are no TS handler closures
 * here — components and agents run **natively** in Rust, and plain action/tool nodes
 * are inert JS seams (they return an empty channel update). The carrier IS the wiring.
 *
 * The carrier readers below mirror the canonical Zod schema in
 * `@adriane-ai/contracts` (`node-metadata.ts`); the SDK stays dependency-free of the
 * contracts package, so the narrowing is duplicated structurally here. The control
 * plane is free to validate the carrier with the contracts schema before handing the
 * definition to this runner.

 * deterministic `<runId>:<nodeId>` child id exists for that case); a nested subgraph
 * inside that child, or `mapSubgraph`'s dynamic N-child fan-out, is NOT walked here —
 * same "no precomputable id at this point" reasoning D5 already established, left for a
 * follow-up rather than expanding this fix's scope.
 *
 * ADR 0068 issue #496: also files ONE request when the suspended node itself is a
 * `human-gate` (top-level or a direct child's own) — `execute_node` suspends a
 * `human-gate` unconditionally, with NO `ApprovalEngine` involvement of its own kind
 * (unlike an agent's `suspendForApproval`, it carries no `approvalRequests` payload).
 * Without this, `ensureNoPendingApprovals` (the control plane's ONLY resume gate) sees
 * nothing pending and a `human-gate` — including D5.3's own injected `__run_gate` node —
 * delays a resume but never actually authorizes one.
 *
 * No-ops (returns the state unchanged) when no engine is given or the run is not
 * suspended. Idempotency: a run that already carries stashed ids (a state that was
 * governed once) is skipped entirely, so re-driving a suspended state does not
 * double-file — for the parent's own gate, a child's, or a human-gate node.
