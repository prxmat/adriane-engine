/**
 * Replay-as-evidence (ADR 0038) — the napi PLUMBING proven end-to-end on the Rust engine.
 *
 * Records a governed catalog run (`ADRIANE_LLM_RECORD`) so the engine journals its LLM outputs +
 * timestamp sequence, then drives {@link replayCatalogGraph} through `engineReplay` and asserts the
 * deterministic fork comes back without re-sampling. This guards the feature-detected replay path
 * from silently rotting; it does NOT assert full faithfulness from the run's *initial* checkpoint —
 * that needs the control plane's persisted checkpoint history + attestation chain and is L5's e2e.
 *
 * Skipped when the native addon is absent. Tolerant of an addon predating replay support.
