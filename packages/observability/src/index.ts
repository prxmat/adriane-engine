/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript observability package is deprecated as part of the
 * execution engine. Tracing/metrics have moved to the Rust `crates/observability`
 * crate, used by `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon; this
 * package remains only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should
 * consume traces via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
