/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript runnable package is deprecated as part of the execution
 * engine. Runnable composition has moved to the Rust `crates/runnable` crate, used by
 * `@adriane/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane/napi` native addon; this package remains
 * only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should compose work
 * via `@adriane/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
