/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript artifact-store is deprecated as part of the execution
 * engine. Versioned artifact storage has moved to the Rust `crates/artifact-store`
 * crate, used by `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon; this
 * package remains only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should
 * reach artifacts via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
