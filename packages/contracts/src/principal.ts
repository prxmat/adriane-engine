/**
 * Role a principal holds WITHIN a tenant (RBAC). It is TENANT-SCOPED and resolved
 * SERVER-SIDE on every request — it is never read from a JWT claim or a client-supplied
 * header. The wire carries it only as an enrichment of the principal for the current
 * tenant (so the Studio can gate UI cosmetically); the server's 403 remains the only
 * authority.
 *
 * `admin`/`billing`/`member` are the ADR 0056 P3 org-role vocabulary (Organization > Team
 * tenancy + granular rights); `approver`/`viewer` are the pre-P3 vocabulary, kept valid here
 * so the schema stays parseable across the rollout window (a control-plane deploy that
 * ships the new vocabulary and its own DB backfill migration are two separate, sequenced
 * steps — this schema must never reject a role value either side of that migration has
 * legitimately in flight). A future ADR-tracked cleanup may narrow this back down once no
 * `approver`/`viewer` row is ever written or read anywhere.
