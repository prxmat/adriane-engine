/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript llm-gateway is deprecated as part of the execution
 * engine. Provider calls now route through the Rust `crates/llm-gateway` crate, used
 * by `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon; this package
 * remains only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should reach
 * the gateway via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
