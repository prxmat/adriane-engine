/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript rag-pipeline is deprecated as part of the execution
 * engine. RAG building blocks have moved to the Rust `crates/rag-pipeline` crate, used
 * by `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon; this package
 * remains only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should build
 * retrieval via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
