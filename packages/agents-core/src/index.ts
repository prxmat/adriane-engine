/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript agents-core is deprecated as part of the execution
 * engine. Agent execution has moved to the Rust `crates/agents-core` crate, driven
 * from `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon; this package now
 * serves only as a fallback when that native addon is absent. New code should run
 * agents via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine directly. See
 * `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
