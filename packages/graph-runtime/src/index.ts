/**
 * @deprecated The TypeScript graph-runtime is deprecated as the execution engine.
 * Graph execution has moved to the Rust `crates/graph-runtime` crate, reached from
 * `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk` through the `@adriane-ai/napi` native addon. This package now
 * serves only as a fallback runtime when that native addon is absent. New code should
 * compile and run graphs via `@adriane-ai/graph-sdk`, not by importing this engine
 * directly. See `docs/adr/0003-ts-engine-deprecated-sdk-on-rust.md`.
